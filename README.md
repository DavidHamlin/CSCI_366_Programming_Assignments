# CSCI 366 PA2 - Bit Board Storage

## Overview

This is an extention of the basic implementation of the 
[Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)) 
game to store the player setup boards in two dimensional bit arrays.

BitArray2D.hpp was provided. 
I updated Server.cpp and wrote BitArray2d.asm, and completed BitArray2D.cpp.
